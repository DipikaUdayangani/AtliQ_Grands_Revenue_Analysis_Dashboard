##AtliQ Grands Revenue Analysis Dashboard

#Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to ineffective decision-making and increased competition. The goal of this project is to help AtliQ Grands regain their market share by incorporating business and data intelligence. As a third-party service provider, I have developed a dashboard to provide insights based on their historical data.
